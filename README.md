# Never-too-late-to-learn
"Never too late learn"  2016.5.25 @ontouchstart created a group to help everybody learn English.

This class is a serious English learning class. Our goal is to learn effective communication skills in the international community. Writing is the first.
@Veronicaâ€…is our TA. Ask for help if you need.
finish your assignment, one at a time.
That is the ONLY way to learn something for real.
